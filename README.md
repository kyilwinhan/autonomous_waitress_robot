This is my graduation thesis for Bachelor of Engineering (Mechatronics) at Technological University (Mandalay), Mandalay Division, Myanmar. 

Also this is the biggest project I'd ever worked till this day and I'm eager to update and upgrade my waitress robot, so stay tuned.
I'm very much pleased to Joshnewans(Articulated Robotic) for his my_bot repository that this repository based and upgraded to ROS2 Jazzy compatiable one.
Still this repo need to be clean up.

So, clone this repository into your directory and have fun.
